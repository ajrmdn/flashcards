          <h5 class="javascript">an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</h5>
          <h5 class="operators">Operators in JavaScript are very similar to operators that appear in other programming languages. The definition of an operator is a symbol that is used to perform an operation. Most often these operations are arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc), but not always.</h5>
          <h5 class="variables">JavaScript Variable. ... JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime. JavaScript uses reserved keyword var to declare a variable. A variable must have a unique name. You can assign a value to a variable using equal to (=) operator when you declare it or before using it.</h5>
          <h5 class="variablenaming">Naming Conventions. Always use the same naming convention for all your code. For example: Variable and function names written as camelCase.</h5>
          <h5 class="functions">Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</h5>
          <h5 class="methods">JavaScript Methods. JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. Property. Value.</h5>
          <h5 class="arguments">Arguments are Passed by Value. The parameters, in a function call, are the function's arguments. JavaScript arguments are passed by value: The function only gets to know the values, not the argument's locations.</h5>
          <h5 class="parameters">Javascript is a functional language meaning that functions are the primary modular units of execution. Functions are obviously very important in Javascript. ... Parameters are variables listed as a part of the function definition. Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked.</h5>
          <h5 class="returns">A return statement returns a value from a function. In JavaScript, return statements cease execution in a function and return a value to the caller; JavaScript functions require an explicit return statement for returning the result of an expression (the value) from a function.</h5>
          <h5 class="chainingmethods">Chaining Methods, also known as Cascading, refers to repeatedly calling one method after another on an object, in one continuous line of code. This technique abounds in jQuery and other JavaScript libraries and it is even common in some JavaScript native methods.</h5>
          <h5 class="strings">Definition and Usage. The String() function converts the value of an object to a string. Note: The String() function returns the same value as toString() of the individual objects.</h5>
          <h5 class="booleans">| Boolean. Boolean is a datatype that returns either of two values i.e. true or false. In JavaScript, boolean is used as a function to get the value of a variable, object, conditions, expressions etc. in terms of true or false.</h5>
          <h5 class="undefined">JavaScript assigns 'undefined' to any object that has been declared but not initialized or defined. In other words, in a case where no value has been explicitly assigned to the variable, JavaScript calls it 'undefined'. 2. Array index or object property that does not exist.</h5>
          <h5 class="nan">Definition and Usage. The NaN property represents "Not-a-Number" value. This property indicates that a value is not a legal number. The NaN property is the same as the Number.Nan property. Tip: Use the isNaN() global function to check if a value is a NaN value.</h5>
          <h5 class="escape">The escape() function was deprecated in JavaScript version 1.5. ... This function makes a string portable, so it can be transmitted across any network to any computer that supports ASCII characters.</h5>
          <h5 class="jsalert">he alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button. An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user. Note: The alert box takes the focus away from the current window, and forces the browser to read the message.</h5>
          <h5 class="comments">Single-line comments are written with two forward slashes ( // ): // This is a comment. All characters immediately following the // syntax until the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript. Block comments, sometimes referred to as mutli-line comments, are written with opening tags ( /* ) and closing tags ( */ ).</h5>
          <h5 class="jquery">jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.</h5>
          <h5 class="attributes">JavaScript Properties. Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object. A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties. Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.</h5>
